# hass_ids_hyyp (hawkMod)

Fixes issue with Home Assistant 2023.4+

Home Assistant integration for IDS Hyyp (Beta)

**Requires Home Assistant version 2023.4 and newer**

*Disclaimer: I am not a programmer/developer/coder/etc. I created this fork since I want to continue using this integration. It was broken for me (2023.4), so I fixed it (for me) and thought I'd share it so other people can also continue using it.

Support, updates, bugfixes, features, etc. will be limited*

# Changelog:

**Version 1.3.0b1**
- Test version
- Added Binary sensor which shows which zone triggered the alarm.

    The sensor binary_sensor.[zonename]_trigger is normally FALSE.
    If the alarm triggers this binary sensor will turn to TRUE on the zone that has triggered the alarm. 
        (Note multiple sensors can trigger the alarm at the same time if it's armed) 
    The sensor will only remain TRUE for 1 update cycle and then go back to FALSE (You should handle this with automations)

Note that due to the polling time to the IDS server this currently only updates once every 60 seconds since there is no push from IDS implemented


**Version 1.2.0**
- If you have more that one stay-profile, there will now be a button entity (and a service) in home assistant for each of the stay-profiles which allows you to arm each of the "Stay-Profiles" and swap between them
- When armed to a stay profile, the stay profile name will be shown in the "armed" box

**Version 1.1.0**
Added the ability to trigger automations
    If you've set up any automations/triggers in the IDS app it will now be available as a "button" entity (and a service) in home assistant

**Version 1.0.1**

Fixed a bug which wouldn't allow set ups with multiple sites to be added.


**Version 1.0.0**

Updated version number only
The integration is working and I want to start fresh with version numbers
API Version number also updated and bumped to 1.0.0

Changed polling to 30 seconds as test. (Don't want to be too agressive on IDS servers)


**Version 0.0.1.7**

Updated Readme and allowed for display on HACS

**Version 0.0.1.6** (Main changes from the original @RenierM26 version)

1) This is a fork of @francoistk 's version. 
    - Fixed the requirement that a stay profile is required for every partitions
2) Reverse engineered the pyHyypApi protobuf files and recompiled. This is not a direct change to ids_hyyp, rather it's a change to the API (https://github.com/hawky358/pyHyypApi)
3) Modified dependancies in IDS_HYYP to point to new modified pyhyypapi package
4) Changed name to IDS Hyyp (Beta)(hawkMod) to avoid potential conflicts with previous version
5) Works with 2023.4 and higher.
